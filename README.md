# Fun-task-with-Dataframe
Task 1.1 Write a function in python that identify which columns have date in them.
Task 1.2 Using these date columns make new columns which are difference between these columns taking 2 at a time. (difference of days between dates). For instance - Data set contains 4 date columns which are start date, end date, DOB and Date of promotion. Then you will form 6 new columns containing difference of these date by taking 2 date at a time. One of the new column would be DOB - end date. But the data can contain any number of date columns (dataset has n number of date columns)
 
Task 1.3 Drop all the original columns containing the date and just keep the newly computed columns
Thing to consider
•	Date can be of different format throughout the column
 
Task 2.1 Write a function in python that drop columns having Pearson correlation more than 0.85
 
Task 3.1 Write a python function that extract zip code from an address column.
Thing to consider
•	Code should be able to identify which columns contains address
•	An address columns may not contain zipcode in some records
•	These are US zipcode (5 digits)
•	US zipcode can be of 9 digits but we want only the first 5 digits

Task 6.1 Write a python function to address typos in a column 
Thing to consider
•	Code should identify which columns have categorical data and do operations on that columns
